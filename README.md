# Stop Go Continue

Created at [Founders and Coders](http://foundersandcoders.org)

## Concept

Stop Go Continue is a process where people feed back on what they would like to **stop** happening (Stop), what they would like to **keeep** happening (Continue), and what they would like to **start** happening (Go). This could be done by writing ideas on post-it notes and sticking them on a board. People then have an opportunity to add an up-vote to ideas they support, e.g. by adding a tick.

## Brief

Create an implementation of Stop Go Continue using Twitter. A tweet sent to **@founderscoders** with the hashtag **#stop**, **#go** or **#continue** will be counted as a new idea. A retweet of a given initial tweet will be counted as a supporting vote.

## Instructions

Run ```node app.js``` either locally, or on a remote host.  


Change the @username section of the twitter query url in the twitteSearch function, and pass it a date parameter matching the start of your Stop Go Continue session.
